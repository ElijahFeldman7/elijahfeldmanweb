<p>At the beginning of the summer I switched my OS from Windows to Linux for a few main reasons. My computer was originally just meant for school work hence the 4gb of memory. The bloated system packages on Windows took up ~50 gb of storage on my 128 gb laptop alone. I was reaching the end of my storage lifeline, and did not want to rely on SD card storage. It made a lot of sense to use the light weight Linux software. What once was ~127 gigabytes of storage was reduced to only 40 gigabytes using Linux. It helped a lot to know exactly what packages and application I had installed. Furthermore, I could delete Microsoft Edge, an inferior browser that Windows pushes on their users. Windows would actively use all of my memory leading to slow wait times and annoying freezing.
<br />
<br />
Another major reason was the customization available with Linux. 
It's so much easier to just rely on the terminal in Linux. I currently am just on Ubuntu, 
but I know that NixOS allows you to write your own system config files. I use the Nordic theme, and
customized the fonts and icons to match this.

<br />
<br />
For those in academia, I would also reccomend switching to Linux. When working in a cluster,
you will need Linux to ssh into the system. It is so much easier that way rather than using
an application such as PuTTY.
<br />
<br />
There are still many reasons to stick with Windows, such as gaming and some software.
Some games don't have Linux support because the developers are afraid of cheating or the 
extra work. To get around this, I reccomend dual-booting a minimal Windows and Linux setup. 
I keep most of my main work on Linux, and will occasionally boot into Windows for gaming or
some software that I need. Virtual machines are also an option, but they are too slow
for me, especially with my limited memory.
<br />
<br />
Overall, I am very happy with my switch to Linux. I have learned a lot about the system, and 
have improved my knowledge of the terminal. It is especially nice to have a system that is 
so light weight and customizable. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a change.
